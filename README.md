# Spacebar Clicker

Spacebar Clicker is an idle game. Press space and collect as many spacebars as you can! 

It was made for #js13kgames 2021 and can be played at the [competition website](https://js13kgames.com/entries/spacebar-clicker) or at [itch.io](https://crocidb.itch.io/spacebar-clicker).

## Tools

In order to build and test locally, it's necessary to have **nodejs** and **npm** installed and install the dependencies:

```
npm install && npm install -G http-server
```

Then run `npm run test` to test the game or `npm run build` to build a minified version of game in a single html file.
